\chapter{Theory of $B \to \mu \mu$ decays; the Standard Model and beyond}
\label{sec:theory}
%Outline
%- The SM
%    > brief introduction
%    > limitations of the SM/why we study it
%    > use of rare decays as a probe of new physics
%- Bs2MuMu and Bd2MuMu decays - how they occur within the SM 
%- BF of Bs2MuMu and Bd2MuMu decays - effective hamiltonian of B2MuMu, what it is in the SM and how NP can enter it
%- Effective lifetime of Bs2MuMu - definition of the ELand its SM value, the dependace on ADG and the precision needed to see NP with the effective lifetime
%- New physics and Bd2MuMu - the BF and the effective lifetime of Bs2MuMu offer complmentarty probes for new physics. MFV of the Bs and Bd ratio as well
