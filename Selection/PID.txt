- Particle identification variables are used to refine the selection of Bs2MuMu candidates and to seperate different b2hh decays. 

- For the selection of Bs2MuMu candidates PID variables are particularly used to reduce the background coming from mis-identified semi-leptonic decays and b2hh decays but they also help to reduce the number of combinatorial backgroudn events. 

- Two types of PID variables are used, DLL variables and ProbNN variables as defined in Section X. 

- Requirements on ProbNN variables vary with the year of data taking because the classifers used in ProbNN variables are tuned to give the best performance depending on the different year of data taking to reflect conditions in the detector at each time. The cuts are chosen to give similar efficiencies for each data sets at selecting signal and removing background. 


- The PID requirements to select Bs/d2MuMu decays in the BF and Bs2MuMu decays in the lifetime analysis are in table X alongside requirements to seperate b2hh decays. 

- The PID requirements used to select Bs/d2MuMu decays in the BF analysis is tighther because more mis-ID decays extend in to the Bd mass window than the Bs mass window therefore tigher requirements are necessary to reduce them to an acceptanble level however this also reduced the signal efficiency.
