There is now a new plan for the selection section. Put both the BF and lifetime selection in one place, since it's pretty much the same as the lifetime selection and it motivates the stripping and BDT studies nicely.


Q: at this point do they know that normalisation channels are needed to measure a BF? Since I've not written the theory chapter who know but I should make sure it's in the theory chapter then.


PLAN

Introduction
Outline what this chapter includes

Backgrounds
Same as before

MC
Same as before but include B2JpsiK MC as well

Trigger
Give more explaination about the trigger choices for the lifetime and the BF differences

Stripping
Go through the stripping cuts and test and conclusion and then preselection.

Tight selection

PID

BDT
