- There is still a lot of background left, to remove this a multivariate classifier is used

- A multivariate classifier is

- We use it to remove background by applying a cut

- The last analysis used a BDT, there are three main reasons to look for a new version. 1. lifetime was an input variable. 2. development of new variables called isolations and 3. selection biases the decay time distribution, already the selection has some bias but the since BDT is the tightest cut and discriminating variables are correlated with the lifetime this will have a large effect. 4. use data as background sample rather than MC. 

- Classifiers for the BF and effective lifetime analysis were developed in parallel
