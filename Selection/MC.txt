- Similated events are needed in the development of the selection and for aspects of the analysis strategy in Chapter X. 

- With simulated events large samples of particular decays can be produced, in much large numbers than are seen in data, which is not hard for Bs2MuMu! From these event the effectiveness of the selection to keep signal events whilst remove background events can be determind. Needed for evaluating efficiencies.

- Monte Carlo simulated events and their passage through the detector, as described in the Chapter X, are used.

- A large range of simulated decays times are needed to understand all the backgrounds relevant for this analysis and the BF analysis. Only those that are used for studies detailed in this analysis are listed in Table X.

- Simulated 2012 Bs2MuMu, B2KPi and B2JpsiK are used for studying the stripping selection in Section X.

- Simulated 2012(?) bbbar2MuMuX and Bs2MuMu are used in training and testing the MVA as described in section X.. The bbbar2MuMuX is the combinatorial background.

- Simulated events for Bs2MuMu, Bs2KK and Bd2KPi for 2011, 2012, 2015 and 2016 are used for analysis work in section X

- The production of simulated events in constantly being developed and leads to different simulation versions which keep trying to be more like data and also the need to be updated for new data taking years.

- Each year of data taking is done with slight different data taking conditions and specification in the trigger therefore MC is needed for each data taking year seperately to understand how the data will behave properly. New simulation models are developed to keep up with the data taking years. 

- Therefore when multiple MC years are combined we need to use similar simulation versions to that the difference in the data taking conditions are not masked by differences in simulation versions. Or if training MVAs need the same simulation version.

- In general the simulation is run with the stripping selections included however usually it's in the flagged mode, so events that didn't pass the stripping are still saved and can be later used after re-processing. 

- However is the requested sample is too large or computationally intensive to produce, events that do not pass the stripping selection are not saved and can never be used. The bbbar2MuMuX is one such sample so the stripping selection can only be made tigher.

- Although MC on the whole correctly represents data there are some areas where it isn't great. These include the PID variablels in MC and also the modelling of the underlying pp event. The PID problems can be corrected for using a package called PIDCalib and MC can be reweighted using data to get the correct MC distributions, this will be described in Chapter X.
