(Prehaps this would make sense in the stripping section? But the idea of the stripping section is that the cuts are loose and the mass cut is not. But then why add in more information about the mass later? Also the mass is lifetime specific!)

- The output of the trigger and stripping selection includes many combintorial background events as well as exclusive background events. 

- After the stripping selection other cuts are applied, tighter selection cuts. These cuts are listed in the Table X and are explained here and shown for B2hh and Bs2MuMu and B2JpsiK.

BDTS
- A Boost Decision Tree (see section X for an explnation) BDT is designed to increase the signal purity of the sample, called the BDTS.  Designed to reduce combinatorial background.

-Trained on 6 input variables, impact parameter and IP chi2 od the B, vertex chi2 of the B (of the Jpsi for B2JpsiK), DIRA, DOCA of two muons, smallest IP of the muons wrt any reconstructed PV

- Trained on sinulated MC and Bs2MuMu events and bbbar2MuMuX MC. The training candidates are reuired to pass the selection in the table I will have at the end of the stripping section for B2hh/bsmumu decays.

- The BDTS is applied to all candidates, including normalisation channels, only candidates with BDTS>0.05 are kept. This is unchanged from the previous publication \ref{}. (Has a rejection power of 70% and signal efficiency of 95% - (compute these?)).


Jpsi Veto

- Bc+->Jpsimunu events when Jpsi2MuMu contribute to the bs2MuMu background when a muon from the Jpsi forms a good vertex with the muon from the Bc decay. Due to the high mass of the Bc this could place mis-reconstructed candidates within the Bs mass window. A 'jpsi veto' can be used to remove background events from Bc+2Jpsimu. The veto works by removing events where one muon from the Bs2MuMu candidate combined with any other opositely charged muon in the event has m_mumu - m_jpsi < 30MeV/c2. it has an rejection power of X on bc events that have passed bsmumu selection cuts in table X and rejects ~ of Bs2MuMu signal events. The expected number of Bc events after all the selection can be found in section X. 


MC cuts
- The MC samples used to train the final choice of the BDT and variables included within the BDT detailed in section X as well as the BDTS use the bbbar2mumuX MC in table X. Tigher cuts on the FD and min IP chi2 than those in table X were applied when the MC sample was created and event that did not pass the cuts are not avaliable for use. Therefore these must be applied to all data and MC to ensure the most effective and reliable performance of the BDT and 


Mass Cuts
- The effective lifetime analysis requires that Bs2MuMu candidation have a dimuon invariant mass greater than 5320 MeV. The motivation come from mass fit studies that are detailed in section X and the consequence of this cut it to remove Bd2MuMu events and most background from mis-identified semi-leptonic or b2hh decays. Also, for the study of B2hh decays in Sections X and Y a smaller mass window is used for b2hh with the purpose of removing background candidates from semi-leptonic decays but I can show the details in that section since it's not the analysis.
