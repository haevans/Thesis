\chapter{Summary and Future Outlook}
%Summaries the results and give future predictions

Hmm what to put in here?

Summary of the BF analysis with a contour plot of the BFs? And the summary plot that goes into the paper.

Conclusions about the lifetime, discussion about the size of the uncertainties and the future prospects. Therefore I need nice eversions of the plots that I showed to Patrick. Also I should download the paper and the plots.

Right, so what do I want to put into my thesis.


The search/testing on the SM has been going on for many years, this has included the search for bs2Mumu and bd2mumu decays which has gone on for over 30 years.
LHCb was designed to measure b decays, Bs2MuMu was outlined in the roadmap of the experiment. First evidence came from LHCb in X with Y, and the first eviddence and first obervation came in the combination paper. With the observations allows measurements to be made of properties such as the EL.
Bs2MuMu decays are important to 
This thesis decouments the first single experiment observation of bs2mumu and the first measurement of the Bs2MuMu effective lifeimte. I should say what the measurements are and also perhaps talk about the ratio of Bs/Bd? Although I'm not sure that is relevant for this but I could inlucde the contour plot as well. First give any/all BF details then move on the the EL. The measured BF allow contraints to be places on NP models, here's a paper that uses the rresults already! 
EL, it's pointless to give A_DG at the moment and therefore a comparison is pointless, but this is non the less a very important measurement, it's a proof of concept that LHCb can do this and sets the scene for the future.

So what does the future hold for the EL measureent? 
Mention the BF measurement that is in the EOL, say the senstivity is supposed to be X in the future as reported in Y at the end of the chapter
The EL, based on the obeerved number of decays, predictions can be makde about the future. However first let us consider the unceratinty we got for the measured number of decays, look it's worse that expected but perfectly reasonable. So for the future, we expect with 8fb, 50 fn and 300 fb. Therefore it will be a long time before it's interesting but with 30fb it will start to be good. However these will be conservative estimates since the analysis stratgu will change as more data is avalible. These are the expected statistical unceratinties and the corresponding systmeatics must decrease too, the largest could are limited by data but some are not, these must be address in the future. An alternative method would be lifetime unbiased which would remove the problems from the acceptance function. 
I would say to put the plots for the current uncertaintues and those at the end of Run 2 and just the numbers for the 50 and 300 fb prediction.
Some nice sentence to finish off. Bs2MuMu has been a decay to watch for years and it still is for the future, the precision of the BF makes it imprnat since NP could still be there and also the Bd is syet to be observed! The ratio is well important. And with more data we get better measurements of A_DG which will ffuther constrain NP.
