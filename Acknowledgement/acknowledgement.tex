\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I have never been one for effusive speaches or declarations, it makes me feel akward, but after almost 4 years working for my PhD there are many acknowledgements I would like to make. Prehaps particulary since this may be the only section of my dissertation that some people read. However I will keep this section quite brief.
I would like to thank Valerie Gibson for giving me the oportunity to do a PhD at Cambridge, her guideance throughout my research and the repeated reading of this dissertation. Also for her support whilst I spent much of my first two years at Cambridge training with Cambridge University Women's Boat Club. 

Marc-Olivier Bettler and Harry Cliff, without their support and encouragment my PhD would naver have ended and I would not have had the oportunity to work on one of the LHCb experiments flagship analyses.

%Also, I would like to thank Val and Marco for their support whilst I spent much of my first two years at Cambridge training with Cambridge University Women's Boat Club. 

I would like to thank the following for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Valerie Gibson, giving me the oportunity to do a PhD, guidance/support, repeated reading of this dissertation
\item John Hill (special mention in Cambridge HEP group?) computing support and something about my batch jobs, though I wasn't as bad as Steve or Bono. Computational infastuction that made this work possible - filling up all of r02/r03.
\item the Science and Technologies Facutlies Counci, for funding. Allowing me to actually do my PhD and also letting me live in Geneva (or close enough) for a year and exciting conference destinations
\item Harry Cliff and Marc-Olivier Bettler, invaluable, pointing me in the right direction, answering stupid questions and their encouragement, patience whilst I was rowing (Support from Val and Marco about rowing, since most people are not)
\item the \bmumu analysis group, (particulary name some??) tireless effort that went into the \BF analysis from which my work on the \el benefited and I have learnt a lot. Feedback and adivse on my work and my benefitting from their experince, for putting up with me
\item LHCb collaboration - relied on collegeues both in cambridge and outside cambridge
\item Cambridge HEP group, past and present memebers, the lunch and coffee group, listening to me complain or talk about rowing and telling me that everything will be ok in the end
\item Selwyn College, for the support particulary the Sport Grant and rowing
\item CUWBC for making my time at Cambridge something more than just physics
\item CUCC for showing me ther is life after rowing
\item Simon?
\item Anouska - of she reads my work?
\item my family for coping with me hardly visiting home for the last 4 years
\item my friends i suppose, tbh you know who you are (mostly you are rowing friends!) For reminding me that what I do it pretty cool
\item Crossroads SG for making my time at CERN great and giving me a home when I was far from the UK
\item Dave Green for teaching
\end{itemize}
