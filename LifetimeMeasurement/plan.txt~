Decay time acceptance (Although this could prehaps be a seperate chapter since it is independant to the fit proceedure)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Why we ned an acceptance and what fuction do we use to get it and how do we get the parameters
      > The selection described in the previous chapter biases the decay time distribution, look here is a plot of the effects of each step in the selection and also and MC truth distribution that we expect, in case you didn't know what a lifetime looks like!
      > The efficiency needs to modelled, which is done so by an acceptance function that is taken from another LHCb paper
      > We did look into other paramterisation but this described best the acceptance that we see
      > The plan is to take the acceptance paramters from fitting the decay time distribution of MC decays so that the parameters are fixed in the fit to data
      > can't use data to obtain the acceptance because there are too few BsMuMu decays and there's not another channel that would have the same efficiency as a function of decay time
      > NTrack weights - MC does not model the event multipility very well, so this is the number of tracks recoreded in the event and also the number of hits in the SPD. The decay time does not depend on these parameters but the isolation variables used in the global BDT do and also these are correctlated with the decay time, so this does mean the decay time distribution after the selection is not the same in MC as it is in data
      > To overcome this we use the more abundant decay Bd2KPi and compare data and MC. We apply the selection listed in X to data and MC but using loose DEC trigger requirements so that there are high statistic and importantly no BDT cut! To select signal decays in data we fit the mass distribution and sWeight the data (do I describe this here or not?) Prehaps describe sWeights briefly. The nTracks normalised plots are shown here (could not use nSPD hits because B2hh triggers cut on this but BsMuMu triggers do not) do data and MC. 
      > The the weights are taken from dividing bins of the normalised Bd2KPi data and MC distributions 
- MC weighting wrt NTracks - This uses the sPlot technique, which I should make sure I understand. Do I want to explain it deeply or not? Also should I explain ML fits? If this is a seperate chapter perhaps I could explain it once in one place?
- MC yearly weightings NB B2JpsiPhi numbers I did not calculate
- Fit results and difference per year

Mass and decay time fit model/Measuring the effective lifetime
---------------------------------------------------------
- stragegy over view - measuring the mass to get sWeights then measuring the lifetime using those weights. Toys are used to get the fit model out.
- Correlation btwn mass and decay time
- mass pdfs - these are from the BF analysis
- decay time PDFs - including the background model
- overview of the toy studies
- to fit for tau or 1/tau
- toys to get the final configuration
- expected sensitivity of the measurement and a comparison with what is needed to distinguish A_DG from -1 and +1
