Decay time acceptance (Although this could prehaps be a seperate chapter since it is independant to the fit proceedure)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      > The selection described in the previous chapter biases the decay time distribution, look here is a plot of the effects of each step in the selection and also and MC truth distribution that we expect, in case you didn't know what a lifetime looks like!
      > The efficiency needs to modelled, which is done so by an acceptance function that is taken from another LHCb paper
      > We did look into other paramterisation but this described best the acceptance that we see
      > The plan is to take the acceptance paramters from fitting the decay time distribution of MC decays so that the parameters are fixed in the fit to data
      > can't use data to obtain the acceptance because there are too few BsMuMu decays and there's not another channel that would have the same efficiency as a function of decay time
      > NTrack weights - MC does not model the event multipility very well, so this is the number of tracks recoreded in the event and also the number of hits in the SPD. The decay time does not depend on these parameters but the isolation variables used in the global BDT do and also these are correctlated with the decay time, so this does mean the decay time distribution after the selection is not the same in MC as it is in data
      > To overcome this we use the more abundant decay Bd2KPi and compare data and MC. We apply the selection listed in X to data and MC but using loose DEC trigger requirements (note 2016 DEC!) so that there are high statistic and importantly no BDT cut! To select signal decays in data we fit the mass distribution and sWeight the data (do I describe this here or not?) Prehaps describe sWeights briefly. The nTracks normalised plots are shown here (could not use nSPD hits because B2hh triggers cut on this but BsMuMu triggers do not) do data and MC. 
      > The the weights are taken from dividing bins of the normalised Bd2KPi data and MC distributions (the ratio of histograms) so that MC looks like data. Then here is the effect of applying the weights and then the BDT cut on Bd2KPi decay time distributions (shown weighted and un-weighted MC comparison with TIS triggers?). Overall not a huge change but it is obvious at low decay times.
      > The Bs2MuMu us weigted using the same nTracks bins and weights, and here are some more plots of the weighted and un-weighted decay time distributions
      > Now we have the MC, the number of MC events for each year isn't the same proportions as data and the acceptance functions vary from year to year (prehaps a plot). Therefore MC needs to be combined taking into account the proportion of decays we expect per year. We do this using some weights and using the B2JpsiPhi channel (These are taken from the BF analysis estimations), this channel is used because it has similar efficiencies per year compared to Bs2MuMu but is more abundant. 
      > Here are all the weights we use.
      > We then fit the weighted cocktail of MC decays in the following way, the decay time dist. is fitting with accept. time expo, where the lifetime in the expo. is fixed to a fit to the MC generated decays. The paramters t0, a and n are allowed to float in the fit. 
      > The pulls and parameters are shown on here, and so are the parameters for each year's acceptance distributions. Note that the parameter values are highly correlated. Here is also a plot of what the acceptance time actually looks like.

Mass and decay time fit model/Measuring the effective lifetime
---------------------------------------------------------
- stragegy over view - measuring the mass to get sWeights then measuring the lifetime using those weights. Toys are used to get the fit model out.
- Correlation btwn mass and decay time
- mass pdfs - these are from the BF analysis
- decay time PDFs - including the background model
- overview of the toy studies
- to fit for tau or 1/tau
- toys to get the final configuration
- expected sensitivity of the measurement and a comparison with what is needed to distinguish A_DG from -1 and +1
