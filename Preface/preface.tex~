\chapter{Preface}

In 2013 I started by PhD at the University of Cambridge and now almost four years later it is finally coming to an end. This dissertation describes the research I have undertaken during those four years; studying \bmumu decays with the LHCb experiment. Two differen measurements of $B \to \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ are presented: the measurement of \bdmumu and \bsmumu \BFs; and the measurement of the \bsmumu \el. These results have been publised in reference~\cite{Aaij:2017vad}. My contributions have been predominately to the \el measurement, howver there is a significant overlap of the two analysis strategies therefore both measurements are described in this disseration.

Chapter~\ref{sec:intro} procued a short introduction to particle physics and a summary of the experimental searches and measurements of \bmumu decays. The theortical motivation for measuring the \bmumu \BFs and the \bsmumu \el is discussed in Chapter~\ref{sec:theory_chptr}.
%The first three chapters set the scene for measurements described in the later chapters. Firstly, there is a short introduction to particle physics and current measurements of \bmumu decays, then the theoretical motivation for studying these decays is described in Chapter~\ref{sec:theory_chptr}. 
%The research documented in this dissertation uses the Large Hadron Collider and the LHCb experiment which are described in the Chapter~\ref{CERN_LHC_LHCb}. The work presented in these chapters is not my own but summaries the work performed by others and the citations show where credit is due.
Chapter~\ref{CERN_LHC_LHCb} describedc the Large Hadron Collider and the LHCb experiment, which provied the data used in the measurements for this dissertation.
%The study of \bmumu decays has been undertaken using data from the LHCb experiment since it began operation, the latest measurement of the \bmumu \BFs and the first measurement of the \bsmumu \el are described in the remaining chapters.
The criteria used to identify \bmumu decays in LHCb data are described in Chapter~\ref{selection_chapter}, this work was carried out over several years by many members of the \bmumu LHCb analysis group. My contributions are the study of the `stripping' selection described in Sections~\ref{strippingold} and~\ref{strippingstudies} and the criteria used to identify \bsmumu decays for the \el measurement in Section~\ref{sec:ELsel}.
The measurements of the \bmumu \BFs are described in Chapter~\ref{sec:BFanalysis} and this work was performed by members of the \bmumu LHCb analysis group and the description focuses in more detail on the part of the analysis strategy that are also used for the \el measurement. Although I did not directly perform the work documented in this chapter, my contributions were to the technical aspects of this measurement; producing the ROOT ntuples containing data and simulated decays; and maintaining the stripping selection applied to data. 
The measurement of the \bsmumu \el and the systematic uncertainties associated with the measurement are described in Chapters~\ref{sec:lifetimemeasurement} and~\ref{sec:systematics}. 
The work documented in these chapters is result of my own effort but it uses inputs from the \BF measurements which includes; the mass shapes for signal and background decays; the yields of \bsjpsiphi decays in data and the expected yields of signal and background decays in data. %The results for the \bmumu \BF and \bsmumu \el lifetime results are published in the paper~\cite{Aaij:2017vad}.

Finally, a summary is given in Chapter~\ref{sec:summaryandoutlook} of the main results documented in this dissertation and also the future prospects for the \BF and \el measurements are discussed. 

I am grateful to have been a member of the LHCb collaboration over the last 4 years and to have been fortunate to work on the study of \bmumu decays, one of the LHCb experiment's flagship analyses. Completing my PhD has been an challenging experience and I am extremely appreciative of the opportunities being at the University of Cambridge has offered outside of my degree. My time spent rowing with Cambridge University Women's Boat Club included some of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my life and Cambridge University Cycling Club that sports other than rowing can ve very enjoyable. %showed me that sport can continue after rowing and perhaps be even more fun. 
Apart from sport, I have found great enjoyment in physics outreach events and undergraduate teaching, particularly seeing others become excited about particle physics or understand new concepts. My year spent at CERN also showed me what it is like to work at an international center of research and that the UK has very small mountains. I am glad that my PhD is finally finished, although this dissertation documents the research outcomes of my PhD it does not do justice to all that has gone into my time at Cambridge.
