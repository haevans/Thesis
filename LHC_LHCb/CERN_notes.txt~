Here I shall write some notes about interesting things that I know or have learnt about CERN and this shall then form a basis of what I shall write about in that section.

Source Marco's Thesis
> CERN = European Organisation for Nuclear Research
> CERN came out of WW2  Louis de Broglie advocated the creation of a european lab (in 1949 in a Eurpoean Cutural conference in Lausanne)
> CERN was establisehd in 1954 - 12 founding member states and Geneva was chosen.
> Noteworthy sucesses are;     
  > Weak Neutral Current at the Garamell bubble chamber in 1973
  > SPS for which stochastic cooling was invented (Nobel prize for that person), W and Z were discovered at the SPS
  > LEP which showed the 3 neutrinos below Mz

LEP stopped in 2000, so the LHC could be built.
