Notes about actual writing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> Alessio does a nice overview of what the detector aims to do and also what happens to particles in a collision - ie b hadrons produced at the collision points, move through the velo and decay, move through rest of the detectors then the trigger gets rid on most events.
> Have a consistent set of facts accross all detector parts or at least the most similar parts ie the tracker TT, T1-3
> Should revise the basic principles of how each part of the detector works - the basic principles



LHCb in general
##################################################################
Marco and Will put the references in the chapter intorduction, this is nice.
> Single arm forward spectrometer designed to study particles containing b quarks
> studies CP violating and rare decays mostly within particles containing b quarks
> Production of b quarks is donimated at the LHC by gluon-gluon splitting, quark-antiquark annihilation and gluon fusion (Will's thesis has a reference) therefore b quarks are boosteed along the beam pipe, hence the design of LHCb.
> B quarks are light compared to the energy in the parton collision, therefore they are higly boosted and end up near the beam pipe. 
> There are some plots of the angular distribution
> LHCb measures from 10 to 300mrad in horizontal plane and from 10 to 250 mrad in the vertical plane, which corresponds to 2.0 to 4.5 pseudorapidity. Horizontal > vertical because of the magent bending particle trajectories.
> pseudo rapitidy is eta = -log(tan(theta/2)) where theta is the angle between the particle and the beam axis.
> Coordinates are on the LHCb picture, z is the beam axis, y the vertical and x the horizontal. Beams collide at the origin. The z axis is the ideal proton orbit around the LHC.
> detector is 10m in length (?)
> Alessio does a nice overview of what the detector aims to do and also what happens to particles in a collision - ie b hadrons produced at the collision points, move through the velo and decay, move through rest of the detectors then the trigger gets rid on most events.

Tracking 
##################################################################
> velo, magnet, TT , T1-3
> goods tracking needed to give good momentum resolution which will lead to good mass resolution which can be used to get rid of signal and background events
> reconstruct electically charged particles as they travel throught the detector
> momentum and therefore quanties related to the moment can be measured from the tracks because there is a magnet
> Momentum is also important to interpret the RICH
> Alessio's thesis has a nice figure of how the different tracking stations are used together
> Differences between types of tracks are:
  - Velo tracks leave tracks only in the velo!
  - T tracks are only in the T1-3 stations and are usually produces by secondary interactions of particles with the detector material
  - Upstream tracksa are in the velo and TT only
  - Downstream tracks are in teh TT and T1-3 stations
  - Long tracks are in the velo, TT and T1-3 stations
> Alessio has information about the track reconstruction algorithms
> Mometum resolution is directly effected by multiple scattering in the detectors therefore tracking detectors are designed to minismise the material in the detector acceptance
> Marco also talks about the track reconstruction
> "The study of CP violation and rare decays in the heavy flavour sector requires the accurate measurement of production and decay vertices and track impact parameters, both for avour tagging and for background rejection. The most stringent demands on the vertex reconstruction arise from the decay time resolution requirements to resolve the fast flavour oscillations induced by B0 s{B0s mixing."  Performance paper,


VELO - vertex locator
##################################################################
> This is next to the beam pipe 
> designed to track charged particles and to reconstruct decay verticies, including secondary verticies of B mesons
> identifies the displacement of the SV from the PV - charateristic of B hadron decays.
> velo also computes the luminoscity using van de meer scans
> find coordinates of tracks next to the interaction point
> B hadrons travel about 1cm before decaying because they have a long lifetime ~1.5ps for the Bs. If we have good vertex resolution this property of B mesons can be used to get rid of backgroud events
> the velo is used to locate tracks/verticies, in the velo the magnet's field is very low, straight track trajectories made in the velo are used as seeds in track resonstruction, used as a pileup detector.
> The VELO can make the best vertex locations and impact parameters if it is very close to the beam.

> There are 21 statins in the VELO on each side
> each half of the velo is the same as the other but they are displaced by 150mm in the z direction which allows them to overlap
> 2 additions stations up stream of the interaction point that are used in the pile-up veto system to remove events that contain too many proton interactions
> the pile up part is 2 segments/things that detect the number of primary interactions and also the track multiplicity in one bunch crossing for LHCb we want about 1 interaction per event (I think)
> The VELO is silicon micro-strip detectors and they alternate as to whether they cover radial or azimuthal coordinates. Each half of the VELO is made to overlap so stop edge effects
> Each half of the VELO is in an aluminum box, since the velo site in the LHC vacuum the box protects the vacuum from potential gas leaks from the modules and also keeps the velo electronics free of the RF EM fields generated by the beam. These are called RF boxed. Where the boxes meet they are corrugated to let them come together well, this part is called the RF foil and is part of the material budget of the VELO
> material budget comes to 17.5% or a radiation length.
> velo stips are 100 micro meters in width
> The Velo can retract, stable beams 8mm from beam during injection 3cm. The VELO can make the best vertex locations and impact parameters if it is very close to the beam.
> There are R-sensors and phi-sensors that alternate. The position on the sensors and z-distance of the sensor shows where the particle went
> R sensors have concentric rings from the ceneter but the distance between strips gradually gets larger (pitch) from the center outwards (Nice picture in Ed's thesis)
> R sensor strips are split into 4 45degree regions so have low capacitance and occupancy, the closest is 8.2mm from the nominal beam axis.
> phi sensor have an inner and outer region where the inner strips are shorts and the 2 sections are skewed wrt each other (Nice picture in Ed's thesis)
> phi sensor split in two due to occupancny and resolution reasons
> skewed phi strips help with pattern recognition
> veto z set up so it covers full lhcb acceptance and also each track goes through at least 3 sensors
>Î©. It can determine inpact parameters to a resolution of 13 microns for high momentum tracks
 the velo forms part of the tracking system
> best resolution is 4 micrometers which allows a lifetime measurement of 50 fs (there's a reference in Ed's thesis)
> In a typical event at LHCb 30-35 tracks per interaction vertex are reconstructed which leads to a PV resolution of 12 micro meters in the transverse plan and 65 along the beam axis.


Also should probably revise how a silicon strip detector works!

Prephaps something like
- What is the velo, what does it do and what are the physics motivations for this. (Primary goal is verticies but also does pile up and seeds reconstruction - maybe not important?)
- How does the velo acheive it's goals, how is it made, it can move (why?)
- How does the Velo perform

Magnet
##################################################################
> Main component of the field is in the y axis therefore the particles are bent horizontally
> Radius on curvature of a path of a charged particle is determined/comes from the momentum that a particle has
> Magnetic field covers the whole LHCb acceptance
> polarity is switched because many lhcb measurement are of asymetries because systematic effects are removed by switching the polarity and taking measurements from the mean of data with each polarity
> peak strength is 1.1T and intergrated field is ~4Tm for 10m tracks.
> field is neigliable in the RICH and peaks between the TT and T1 station,
> Hall probes were used to mapp the magnetic field - what are these?
> the agreement btwn measured and calculated field is better than 1% - see Will's ref 80
> Would be nice to have a picture of the field overlaid on the detector - Marco has this
> Warm dipole magnet
> magents strength allows momentum resolution of delta p / p ~0.4%
> polarity is inverted to study left-right asymmetries dectection effects and evaluate systematics for CP-vioation related analyses.
> The design of the magnet with an integrated magnetic field of 4 Tm for tracks of 10 m length had to accommodate the contrasting needs for a field level inside the RICHs envelope less than 2 mT and a field as high as possible in the regions be- tween the vertex locator, and the Trigger Tracker tracking station- LHCb detector at the LHC(it has potentially used references in)
- to get the required momentum resolutions for charged particles the magnetic field in- tegral   Bdl must be measured with a relative precision of a few times 10â4 and the position of the B-field peak with a precision of a few millimetres
- want to have no magnetic field in the RICH.


TT - Tracker turicensis
##################################################################
> silicon trackers with a pitch (distance between strips) 0f 200 microns. As in I think the angle between 1st and 2nd layer is 5 degrees if the 1st layer is vertical and the second is not quite vertical
> There are 4 layers and the middle 2 layers are rotated +/- 5 degrees wrt the vertical
> designed to detect low momentum particles that are swept out of the detector by the magent. So I guess covers at least the full LHCb acceptance. Combining Velo and TT tracks gives momentum accuracy of ~20%
> 150cm wide and 130cm high - active area of 8.4cm^2
> 4% of a radiation length
> within the fringe of the magnetic field
> higher momemtum tracks not bent out of the acceptance are used in the full tracking system for the momentum measurement
- The TT is a 150cm wide and 130cm high planar tracking station that is located up- stream of the LHCb dipole magnet and covers the full acceptance of the experiment.
- active area of 8.4m^2
- single hit resolution was needed to be about 50 micro meters, then the momentum resolution is dominated by multiple scatters over the full range of possible particle momenta. Read out strip pitches of about 200 micrometers achieves this.
The TT is kept at 5 degrees C to limit radiation damage
To aid track reconstruction algorithms, the four detection layers are arranged in two pairs, (x,u) and (v,x), that are separated by approximately 27 cm along the LHC beam axis.

T1-3 - Tracking stations
##################################################################
- IT active ares is 4.0m2
- The IT covers a 120 cm wide and 40 cm high cross shaped region in the centre of the three tracking stations downstream of the magnet. 
> These three stations are split into 2
> inner part (IT) of the stations are the same as the TT in design but smaller covering 120 by 40cm cross shaped region around the beam pipe with an active area of 4m^2 and a radiation length of 3.5%
> The IT covers 2% of the detector acceptance but 20% of tracks go through it so needs good resolution
> OT is a drift time detector
> Outer tacker is an array of gas tight Kapton straw tubes each with a diameter of 4.9mm, 70% argon and 30% CO2 fills them which gives a fast drift time of below 50ns and a resolution bettern than 200 microns
> outside of each tube acts as a cathode and there's a wire in the middle as the anode, the gas is ionised. A potential difference accross the tube makes an electron avalanche when a changed particles goes through.
> The OT has 4 layers like the TT and IT with the +/- 5 degrees rotation
> OT occupancy < 10% and the active area of 5971x4850 mm^2
> A picture would make clear the arrangement of the IT and OT in a station.
> silicon technology is expensive but offers high spacial resolution it is therefore only used in the inner part of the tracking stations
> IT dimensions chosen to keep IT occupancy < 10%
> "straw tubes are arranged in two staggered mono-layers "
> "An inner layer of carbon-doped Kapton (Kapton XC) acts as a cathode for the collection of the positive ions. The outer layer, made of a polyimide-aluminium laminate, provides shielding and together with the anode wire forms a transmission line for the effective transport of the high-frequency signals."
> Largest OT station overs 600 cm x 490 cm.
> OT has low track density but the IT has a high track density
> LHCb website and Alessio's thesis have a nice diagram showing the relative size differences between the TT and T1-3
> Mometum resolution is directly effected by multiple scattering in the detectors therefore tracking detectors are designed to minismise the material in the detector acceptance
>The OT tubes are 2-ish deep in each layer of the tracker so that they slot between each other and give maximum coverage/don't miss anything - arranged in 2 layers
> The +/- 5 degrees helps to improve the track reconstruction algorithms
The OT - do the tubes coved the whole vertical height of the detector? So you only know the x,z position of the particle? Alison said that is you know the time you can work out the vertical position - so prehaps I need to understand straw tubes.
>"If one also precisely measures the timing of the current pulses of the wires and takes into account that the ions need some time to drift to the nearest wire, one can infer the distance at which the particle passed the wire. This greatly increases the accuracy of the path reconstruction and is known as a drift chamber."
> "The outer parts of the tracking stations T1{T3 are equipped with a straw-tube detector (OT) [31]. Charged particles traversing the straw-tubes will ionise the gas along their trajectory. The drift-times of the ionisation electrons to the wire located at the centre of the straw are measured with respect to the beam crossing signal. The distribution of the recorded drift-time, which is proportional to the distance of the particle trajectory to the wire, is shown in Figure 9 (right)." Performace paper.

Why are the tracking +/-5 degrees?
Would be nice to explain how much larger the OT is compared to the IT and the TT in easy to read and understand terms. There's a picture to illustrate this.

How does the tracking work and preform?
#######################################
How does it work? - Performance paper tells me all
> tracks are defined depending on which tracking station they are detected in
>Velo tracks only have tracks in the VELO and are used to reconstruct PV
> T tracks cross the tracking statiosn T1-3 are are cause by particles being created from interactions from the detector, important for pattern recognition in the RICH 2
>> Up stream tracks leave stuff in teh velo and the TT, so are upstream of the magnets, typcially low momentum particles that are swept out of the detector acceptance by the magnetic field. Poor mometum resolution but can be used to undersand backgrounds in the RICH and help with flavour tagging of B hadrons
> Down stream tracks leave stuff in the TT and T1-3  the decay products of long lived particles
> Long tracks are in the whole detector and have the most previse resolutions, these are the most important for b-hadron decays
> Tracking algorithms take as seeds/starting points tracks in the VELO or the TT and then add information from the other detectors into the reconstruction.
> Once the tracks have been reconstructed they enable parameters linked to the tracks to be reconstructed, once a vertex position has been fitted for the the vertex chi2 can be found. Parameters such as the fligh distance and the flight distanace chi2 measure how far the particle moved before decaying. There is also the impact parameter which is wrt the interaction vertex, it is the distance of closest approach between the tracks and the PV (useful for b hadrons live a while)
> tracks in the VELO and T1-3 are used a seed to help find tracks in other parts of the detector, by searching in windows of the other detectors. Once the segments have all been found a Kalam fiter algorithm is used for fit the possible trajectories and this takes account of multiple scattering an dengery loss in the detector.
> fitter gives some tracks that are clones, these are removed bu an algorithm and the one with the most hits wins.
> if two or more tracks have many hits in common, the one with the most hits is kept
> fake tracks occur as well this is generally when the VELO and the T stations are incorrectly associtaed, the amount this happens depends on the multiplicty of the event and can be from 6.5% to 20%. Cuts are applied on a neural network to remove these.
> Kalam fitter gives a chi2/ndof for the track. LHCb makes requirements on these for each year to ensure that only good tracks are used. 
> tracking performace seems to be a diferent concept to the preformance of each detector. 
> Overall track momentum resolution is ...
> efficiency to correctly reconstruct tracks is ...
> IP resolution - from the VELO, varies with mometum, transverse momentun, it's ~35 mum for a particle with PT of 1GeV/c
> Vertex resolutions- this comes from the VELO, 10-25 mum transverse to the beam and 50-100 mum parallel to the beam, but it depends on the number of tracks in the event. There are plots in the performance papaer and VELO performance paper that ilustrate this. - needed for good decay time res, helps to identift types of B hadron and to remove background.
> decay time resolutions again from the VELO, this is super important to Bs ocisllating system. 50ns typlically, this was evaluated in Run 1.
> TT and IT have resolution of 50 mum in Run 1
> OT has fridt time of 35 ns and track resolution of ~200 mum for a particle with P > 10GeV, then mutilple scattering isn't what limits the resolution but the detector itself.
> Track efficiency is evalutated for long tracks since they have the best resolution and are also most important for physics analyses. Efficiencies vary with p, eta, nTracks and NPVs and they were computed with JPsi2MuMu tag and probe method (I don't understand how that works), the momentum resolution is also computed but this depends on the mometum of the final state particles(there is a nice plot) and therefore the mass resolution depends on the particle properties as well and it has been measured for different resonances and the Z.

PID
##################################################################
> Designed to distinguish electrons, muons, protons, kaons and charged pions and also photons from neutral pions
> These are the daughter particles which are mostly what we detect, so we need to know what they are in order to find out what type of B meson they came from and also to distunguish events with similar kiniematics and topology
> Marco explains how the PID all works togerhter to get the DLL PID information


RICH
##################################################################
> Two RICH stations, one after the VELO and the other after the tracking stations, they cover complementary momentum and angular regions
> Ring imaging cherenkov detectors
> when charged particles go through a dielectriv medium they polarise it locally, if the particle speed it greater than the speed of light photons coherently interfer creating a wavefront at an angle theta_c wrt the particle direction (Maroc has a reference here) this angle is related to the particle velocity as cos(theta_c_) = 1/n.beta, where beta = v/c. If the speed is < c the photons deconstructively interefer therefore making no wavefront.
> Measuring the angle tells us how fast the particle is moving. This information combined with the mometum from the tracking stations tells us what the particle is - right?
>In the RICH light produced in the dewtector moves through the radiator and is refected off a spherical mirros on to a detector that is sensitive to the position. Hybrid Photon Detectors are used, but the magnet's field can degrade these so the RICH is protected/shielded so this does not happen.
> Rich 1 has a silicon areogel senstivit to up 10GeV and C4F10 sensitive to 10-60 GeV. All the mirros and detection stuff are locatioed outside the LHCb acceptance
> THe Rich 2 is sensitive to 15-100 GeV and is made of CF4. It covers +/- 120 mrad in the horizontal and +/- 100 mrad in the vertial so only where you expect to get high energy particles.
> The radius of the ring gives a measure of theta_c and therefore the velocity. 
> âThe RICH 1 detector is shielded from the magnetic field using iron plates which reduce the magnetic field in the HPD plane to a maximum value of 2.4 mT.â Will 
> It is the HPDs that need to be shielded.
> RICH detector give a ring of light, this light is related to the speed of the particle, therefore with the momentum from the tracking detectors the mass and therefore the identity of the particles can be determined. 
>  e, Î¼, â¡, K and p+ identification in the rich, They have to be charge particles.

Calorimeters
##################################################################
> these are behind the RICH 2 and consist of the preshower (SPD/PS), electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) and the hadronic calorimeter (HCAL)
> Calorimeters provide information to the trigger are hadron, electron and photn transverse momentum
> These measure the position and energy of hadrons, electron and photons.
> The SPD distinguished between neutral and charged particles, it is the Scintillator Pad Detector, it seperates photons and electrons which would have similar profiles in the ECAL
> The preshower(PS) is a thin layer of lead then scintillators like the SPD. It makes the most of the different interaction lengths of the electron and charged pion. Electrons will produce showers in the lead but the pions will not. This information is used the the trigger hlt1. 1% of pions will interact with the lead converter. This is necessary in case pions begin to shower in the ECAL.
> The ECAL is for electromagnetic showers and is used in the L0, it wants all the shower to develop in the ECAL for the best E_T resolution.
> ECAL has energy resolution os deltaE/E = 9%/sqrt(E)(+)0.8% where E is in GeV - this requires information from the PS
> HCAL energy resolution deltaE/E = 69%/sqrt(E)(+)9%
> functions of the Calo; L0 trigger from transverse energy of hadrons, electrons and photons, improved PID of electrons, photons and hadrons as well as energy and position. Reconstruction on pi0 and prompt photons needed for flavour tagging and study of B meson decays.
> PS does charged pions and electrons, SPD pi0. itâs scintillator lead scintillator
> all the calorimeters follow the same principle, scintillation light is transmitted to a PMT by wavelength shifting fibres.  When a particle looses energy via ionisation or excitation of atoms in a material it is travelling through, sometimes depending on the material this energy reemerges as visible or UV light which can then be measured by a PMT.
> A calorimeter detects energy of a particle by absorbing it, absorbers make showers of secondary particles and so on whilst scintillators or MWPCs detect the energy as light. I suppose the amount of ionisation and excitation depends on the energy of the incident particles.
> ECAL, scintillator/lead, same for the HCAL - sampling calorimeters
> EM calorimeters are when particles (electrons, positrons and photons) interact electromagnetically, through ionisation, bremstralung or pair production, depending on their energy.
> Hadronic calorimeters particles interact via the song force. 
> SPD is first, before an absorber so that electrons will make light in it but photons will not. Then there is a lead absorber before the PS, the PS is used to separate pion and election showers. 
> Why do pions interact with the ECAL?
> ECAL is designed to capture the whole shower where as the HCAL is not. 

Muon detectors
##################################################################
> 5 muon stations, one after RICH 2 the rest at the end after the HCAL
> high pt muons are used in the trigger because they will have come from interesting B mesons.
> muons have a high matter penetrating power compared to electrons, hadrons ets, this is expolited in the muon station positions and their makeups, this is because they do no interact via the strong force and they have a large mass so that energy loss through bremstralung is low
> the muons stations are outside the magnetic field, therefore track reconstruction is fast.
> They cover the full LHCb angular acceptance
> The granulartity reduces due to multiple scarttering that increase in likelihood with distance from the beam pipe
> There are ison absorbers of ~80cm between each muon station to remove particles that are not muons. There is also an iron wall after the end of the last muon station to stop particles travelling downstream into the detector.
> The stations used multiwire proporinal chamebers on the outer parts but the inner sections use gas electron multipler foils because the flunence is high in the inner most region and MWPCs won't get the needed effieicny.
> MWPC uses Ar, CO2 and CF4 at 40%, 55% and 5%. There is a pitch of 2mm. I think there is a high detection efficinecy because therer are 4 sentivive gas layers in each layer and only one layer needs to rehister a signal.
> GEM thin Kapton foil between copper plated 140 micro meter pitch A very strong volage is applied accross the copper plates.
> A muon is identified if hits in the muon station can be matched to what is seen in the tracking stations.
> âThe muon system provides fast information for the high-pT muon trigger at the earliest level (Level-0) and muon identification for the high-level trigger (HLT) and offline analysis.â
> muons are present in the final states of many b hadron decays
>âis composed of five stations (M1-M5) of rect- angular shape, placed along the beam axisâ
> âThe minimum momentum of a muon to cross the five stations is approximately 6 GeV/c since the total absorber thickness, including the calorime- ters, is approximately 20 interaction lengths.â
>â Station M1 is placed in front of the calorimeters and is used to improve the pT measurement in the trigger.â
> âStations M1âM3 have a high spatial resolution along the x coordinate (bending plane). They are used to define the track direction and to calculate the pT of the candidate muon with a resolution of 20%. Stations M4 and M5 have a limited spatial resolution, their main purpose being the identification of penetrating particles.â
> decay including muons are topologically similar to those including hadrons i.e. Bsmumu, B2pipi, B2pik! Therefore the muons allow good identification of penetrating muons with a low hadron mis ID probability
> Size of the muons stations increases with distance from the interaction point just like the OT stations
> the muon stations effectively cover the full LHCb angular acceptance
> âThe muon system covers the angular range 20-306 mrad in the horizontal plane, and 16-258 mrad in the vertical plane. This is su cient to capture about 20% of muons from semileptonic B decays [80].â
> the absorbers are made of iron
>âThe muon stations use two diâµerent technologies; multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPCs) are used for all regions except the inner region of M1. In this region the expected particle rate would exceed safety limits for ageing, so triple-GEM (gas electron multiplier) technology is used instead [80].â
