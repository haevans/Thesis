Here are some very interesting facts about LHCb collated in order of the parts of the detector.

The sources are
Will Barter's Thesis - his reference 80 is used a lot
Ed Greening's thesis
Marco's thesis

LHCb general
##################################################################
Marco and Will put the references in the chapter intorduction, this is nice.
> Single arm forward spectrometer designed to study particles containing b quarks
> studies CP violating and rare decays mostly within particles containing b quarks
> Production of b quarks is donimated at the LHC by gluon-gluon splitting, quark-antiquark annihilation and gluon fusion (Will's thesis has a reference) therefore b quarks are boosteed along the beam pipe, hence the design of LHCb.
> B quarks are light compared to the energy in the parton collision, therefore they are higly boosted and end up near the beam pipe. 
> There are some plots of the angular distribution
> LHCb measures from 10 to 300mrad in horizontal plane and from 10 to 250 mrad in the vertical plane, which corresponds to 2.0 to 4.5 pseudorapidity. Horizontal > vertical because of the magent bending particle trajectories.
> pseudo rapitidy is eta = -log(tan(theta/2)) where theta is the angle between the particle and the beam axis.
> Coordinates are on the LHCb picture, z is the beam axis, y the vertical and x the horizontal. Beams collide at the origin. The z axis is the ideal proton orbit around the LHC.
> detector is 10m in length (?)
> Alessio does a nice overview of what the detector aims to do and also what happens to particles in a collision - ie b hadrons produced at the collision points, move through the velo and decay, move through rest of the detectors then the trigger gets rid on most events.



VELO
##################################################################
> This is next to the beam pipe 
> designed to track changed particles and to reconstruct decay verticies, including secondary verticies of B mesons
> There are 21 stations in the VELO on each side
> 2 additions stations up stream of the interaction point that are used in the pile-up veto system to remove events that contain too many proton interactions
> The VELO is silicon micro-strip detectors and they alternate as to whether they cover radial or azimuthal coordinates. Each half of the VELO is made to overlap so stop edge effects
>Each half of the VELO is in an aluminum box, since the velo site in the LHC vacuum the box protects the vacuum from potential gas leaks from the modules and also keeps the velo electronics free of the RF EM fields generated by the beam. These are called RF boxed. Where the boxes meet they are corrugated to let them come together well, this part is called the RF foil and is part of the material budget of the VELO
> material budget comes to 17.5% or a radiation length.
> The Velo can retract, stable beams 8mm from beam during injection 3cm. The VELO can make the best vertex locations and impact parameters if it is very close to the beam.
> There are R-sensors and phi-sensors that alternate. The position on the sensors and z-distance of the sensor shows where the particle went
> The sensors are themselves split in to sections
> vertex resolution in the transverse plane 10-20 mircons, in the z directions 50-100 microns depending on the number of tracks in teh vertex. It can determine inpact parameters to a resolution of 13 microns for high momentum tracks
 the velo forms part of the tracking system
> identifies the displacement of the SV from the PV - charateristic of B hadron decays.
> velo also computed the luminoscity using van de meer scans
> each half of the velo is the same as the other but they are displaced by 150mm in the z direction which allows them to overlapp
> velo stips are 100 micro meters in width
> R sensors have concentric rings from the ceneter but the distance between strips gradually gets larger (pitch) from the center outwards (Nice picture in Ed's thesis)
> phi sensor have an inner and outer region where the inner strips are shorts and the 2 sections are skewed wrt each other (Nice picture in Ed's thesis)
> best resolution is 4 micrometers which allows a lifetime measurement of 50 fs (there's a reference in Ed's thesis)
> find coordinates of tracks next to the interaction point
> the velo is used to locate tracks/verticies, in the velo the magnet's field is very low, straight track trajectories made in the velo are used as seeds in track resonstruction, used as a pileup detector.
> the pile up part is 2 segments/things that detect the number of primary interactions and also the track multiplicity in one bunch crossing for LHCb we want about 1 interaction per event (I think)
> R sensor strips are split into 4 45degree regions so have low capacitance and occupancy, the closest is 8.2mm from the nominal beam axis.
> phi sensor split in two due to occupancny and resolution reasons
> skewed phi strips help with pattern recognition
> B hadrons travel about 1cm before decaying because they have a long lifetime ~1.5ps for the Bs. If we have good vertex resolution this property of B mesons can be used to get rid of backgroud events
> In a typical event at LHCb 30-35 tracks per interaction vertex are reconstructed which leads to a PV resolution of 12 micro meters in the transverse plan and 65 along the beam axis.
