2Here are some notes about the LHC - without any references, I shall say the source that the notes came from and then the references can be found from there. NB notes are paraphrased/summaries not direct quotes.

Marco's thesis
> built in the LEP tunnel
> built to test the SM, uncover NP and to search for the Higgs
> lumoniscity and energy are important measures for particle colliders since they then allow for the production of short lived massive particles (or not so massive)' Luminoscity is a measure of the collision rate.
-----------------------------------
> NB I should mention what lumonscity is since I shall be refering to it in my thesis
-----------------------------------
> LHC design lumi is 10^34 cm-2s-1, which couldn't be done for protons antiprotons since we can't make that many antiprotons. The lumi is acheived by a combination of number of bunches per beam and also the revolution frequency of the beams.
> beams are focused for experiemnts by magnets - I think quadropoles
> the protons travel in seperat vacuum chambers magnetic field in each chamber is in oposite directiosn acheived by dipole magnets
> LHC was supposed to deliver collisions at 14 TeV, using the LEP tunnel needed magnets to get that energy that could give 8.3T, to acheive this the magnets had to be superconduction therefore supre cooled. Also had to used protons due to bremstralung from electron. Magnets are at 1.9K
> LHC also collides lead ions and here the magnetic field constrains how energetic the beams can be - 2.76 TeV per nucleon


This is now a quote of what went wrong in 2009 when it was turned on, I don't plan on mentioning this (unless other people do in their theses, but I think this is the reason that Run 1 was at 7/8 TeV and we are yet to see 14 TeV collisions

"The superconducting magnets are cooled down to 1.9 K. In itself, the thermal energy density in the magnet cold mass is amazingly low. However, this is far from being a safe state. The di↵erence of energy density between the magnet cold mass and the ambient environment in the tunnel is tremendous, and any thermal insulation weakness can have dramatic consequences. Particularly the incident of 19 September 2008 [134] illustrates such consequences. A bad elec- trical connection between two dipole magnets became more and more resistive in a thermal runaway process and an electric arc developed, releasing up to 4 MW. The bad connection was vaporised and the helium enclosure punctured by the electric arc. Helium was thus released from the cold mass into the insulation vacuum. The pressure was such that longitudinal forces developed, resulting in the displacement of cold masses and even entire magnets. Interconnec- tions between magnets were crashed, some magnet supports were ruptured. The magnets were repaired and cleaned, and measures to reduce the impact of a possible future accident were implemented. The delay caused by this bad connection was about 14 months. It directly af- fected the content of this document, preventing the LHC to deliver collisions and consequently preventing LHCb to take data."

> The LHC accelerator chain
> this used already exiting but modified accelerators, in order to get the required proton beam energy and density and spacin needed for the LHC. The chain, in order of use and therefore increasing energy is; Linac2, Proton Synchrotron Booster, the PRoton Synchrotron, the Super Proton Synchrotron and then the LHC.

> 4 interaction points and 6 expeiments.
> CMS and ATLAS are general purpose detectors
> TOTEM is in and near CMS wants to measure pp cross seciton and the luminoscity
> LHCf is near atlas and looks at (140m either side) verify hadronic models at high energies to help understand the highest energy cosmic rays
> ALICE, lead ions to look at quark gluon plasma
> LHCb single arm forward spectormete which is designed to make precision SM measuements focused on CP violating processes and decays of b and c hadrons

The LHC according to Susan

> conceived in 1980s and installed in the 27km LEP tunnel
> it's a synchrotron accelerator
> 1232 dipole mahnets are used to bend the beams and they are cooled by liquid helium at 1.9K. Quadrupole magnets are then used to focus the beams
> Protons are obtained from ionised hydrogen and are then accelerated to 50MeV by the linac2, the PSB accelrated one bunch per ring up to 1.4GeV. 
> The PS further accelerates the beams to 25 GeV and gets the 25ns splitting for the LHC ready.
> The SPS increases the energy to 450 GeV then the beams enter the LHC, there they are further accelerated by 8 radio frequency cavities which get them to the correct energies and also sort of the bunch structure/distriution for collisions.
> 3600 bunches could be included into the LHC but it is lower at 2808 bunches to allow for gaps in the bunches which makes it possible to transfer them between the different accelerators in the chain.
> LHC operating lumi is 10^34 cm-2-s

The LHC according to Ed Greening

> The LHC is designed to run at 14TeV but had not done before LS1 but operated at lower energies from 2010-2013
>Protons some from a hydrogen gas source
> PSB is 4 parallel accelerators, once the protons leave the PSB and are injected into the PS they are divided into bunches. 
> SPS have diameter of 6.5km
> protons all move together in bunches up until they are injected into the LHC where they are split into 2 opositly rotating bunches.
> The stength of the dipole magnets increases as the energy of the beams increase.
> 392 quadrupole magnets are used to focus the beams - beams are sepreated by about 7.5m
> 16 RF cavities are used to accelerate the protons, the cavieis are metallic containers designed to allow EM waves to resonant. Protons that enter the cavity accereated by the EM fields (which osscilate at 400 MHz), protons arriving at different times feel difference forces, due to the oscillations - those that are too early therefore moving too fast receive a smaller acceleration that those arriving too late therefore evening our the size of the bunch so that they all arrive at one time.
> data taking can be divided into 3 differnt years at the LHC, with different lumnis and number of bunches and energies - none on the were the same as expected for the LHC and also for the luminiscity of LHCb.

The LHC accoring to Harry

> 26.7km, tunnel is between 45m and 170m below ground and is roughly circular
> 2 seperate rings are required becuase it accelerated protons which have the same charge
> there are 4 interation points on the ring and at each there are caverns underground which house the 4 big detectors
> CMS and ATLAS are 4 pi detectors and are barrel shaped but have endcaps where the beams are
> incident occurred in 2008

The LHC according to Will Barter

> The LHC was orignially designed to have 25 ns between bunches but for the most of Run 1 the spacing between bunches was 50ns (I think that this has changed a bit for Run 1) there are aroudn 1.15x10^11 protons per bunch and the design allows for 2808 bunches per beam. 
> Run 1 had abut 140 bunches for 50ns bunch spacing.
> Beams in the LHC travel through ultra high vacuum condidtions, the beams are a few mm wide until they are focussed to around 14 microns. 
> the lumi at LHCb is aimed to be around 1 proton interation per bunch crossing, to allow for easire reconstruction of SVs
> reduced lumi is acheived by defocusing the beams as LHCb which is a technique known as luminoscity leveling

Information from CERN LHC brocher

> there are 7 active experiments on the LHC ring - ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, TOTEM, ALICE, LHCf and MoEDAL. There are 5 active experiments on the SPS and 2 on data anlysis, 2 active on the PS and 1 in data analysis and also experiemnts base on ISOLDE and AD, as well as non accelerator experiments and th

> if it used warm dipole magnets that it would need to be 120km in lenght and use 40x the amount of power to accelerate the particles.

From the CERN website

> dipole magnets are 1232 and 15m in lenght - these bend the beams (RF cavities accelerate the beams)
> quadrapole magnets are 392 are only 5-7m in length
> just before collisions another type of magnet squezes the bunches of protons together
> there are 16 RF cavities, I think then 8 per beam.

> SPS turned on in 1976 and was a proton antiproton collider where in 1983 they found the W and Z bosons. The SPS uses room temperature magnets, and there are 1317 including 744 dipole magnets

> the PS accelerated heavy ions that come from the Low Energy Ion Ring as well as protons from the PS. The PS started in 1959, and since then has undergone many modificantion and accelerated a large range of different particles, electron, alpha partilce and oxygen nulcei. It was the first CERN accelerator but since then has mostly been used to provide particles for other accelerators since 1970. It is 628m in circumference and has 277 magnets including 100 dioples and accelerated up to 25 GeV

> "Linac 2 started up in 1978, when it replaced Linac 1. It was originally built to allow higher intensity beams for the accelerators that follow it in CERN's accelerator complex. Linac 2 will be replaced by Linac 4 in 2020."

From Run2 brocher
About Run2

> Early 2013 the LHC shut down and repairs and upgrades to strength it were performed, 18 magnets were replaced due to wear and tear
> 10000 electircal connections between dipole magnets had shunts added to avoid what happened in 2008
> the way magnets quench - revert back to their warm state, has now an improved protection system
> "There will be fewer protons per packet – or “bunch”: 1.2 x 1011 compared to 1.7 x 1011 in 2012. When dozens of collisions occur at once, it becomes harder for a detector’s computers to disentangle which particle comes from which collision. With fewer protons in each collision, this problem of “pileup” will be less severe. However, the bunches of protons will be separated in time by 25 nanoseconds compared to 50 nanoseconds. The LHC will thus deliver more particles per unit time as well as more collisions to the experiments."

But there is still more to do and more observables become avalibale with higher energies and more statistics.
